## üìñ Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the first "look under the hood" in any data-science or machine-learning project. Done well, it tells you what's in the tank, how clean the fuel is, and whether the engine you're about to build can run without stalling.

Now, that being said, every dataset is unique, so this guide is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, it provides a comprehensive checklist of steps, techniques, and best practices to help you understand your data, assess its quality, and uncover patterns that inform modeling strategies.

### Why EDA Matters for Machine Learning

EDA is crucial because it:

- **Prevents costly mistakes** by identifying data quality issues early
- **Informs feature engineering** by revealing patterns and relationships
- **Guides algorithm selection** by understanding data characteristics
- **Identifies bias and fairness concerns** before they become production problems
- **Ensures reproducibility** through systematic documentation

## üíª Code Examples and Techniques

This section provides data-agnostic code examples for common EDA tasks. Adapt these snippets to your specific dataset by replacing generic variable names (`df`, `target_column`, `numerical_cols`, etc.) with your actual column names.

### Initial Data Inspection

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from scipy import stats
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

# Load your dataset
# df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Basic information
print("Dataset Shape:", df.shape)
print("Memory Usage:", df.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / 1024**2, "MB")
print("\nData Types:")
print(df.dtypes.value_counts())
print("\nFirst few rows:")
display(df.head())
```

### Missing Value Analysis

```python
# Missing value analysis
missing_data = df.isnull().sum()
missing_percent = (missing_data / len(df)) * 100
missing_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Column': missing_data.index,
    'Missing_Count': missing_data.values,
    'Missing_Percentage': missing_percent.values
}).sort_values('Missing_Percentage', ascending=False)

# Display missing value summary
print("Missing Values Summary:")
display(missing_df[missing_df['Missing_Count'] > 0])

# Visualize missing patterns
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), cbar=True, yticklabels=False, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Missing Value Patterns')
plt.show()
```

### Numerical Variable Analysis

```python
# Identify numerical columns
numerical_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()

# Summary statistics
print("Numerical Variables Summary:")
display(df[numerical_cols].describe())

# Distribution plots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(len(numerical_cols), 2, figsize=(15, 5*len(numerical_cols)))
for i, col in enumerate(numerical_cols):
    # Histogram
    axes[i,0].hist(df[col].dropna(), bins=30, alpha=0.7)
    axes[i,0].set_title(f'{col} - Distribution')
    axes[i,0].set_xlabel(col)
    
    # Box plot
    axes[i,1].boxplot(df[col].dropna())
    axes[i,1].set_title(f'{col} - Box Plot')
    axes[i,1].set_ylabel(col)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Outlier detection using IQR
def detect_outliers_iqr(data):
    Q1 = data.quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = data.quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
    return ((data < lower_bound) | (data > upper_bound)).sum()

print("Outlier Analysis (IQR method):")
for col in numerical_cols:
    outlier_count = detect_outliers_iqr(df[col])
    outlier_percent = (outlier_count / len(df)) * 100
    print(f"{col}: {outlier_count} outliers ({outlier_percent:.1f}%)")
```

### Categorical Variable Analysis

```python
# Identify categorical columns
categorical_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.tolist()

print("Categorical Variables Analysis:")
for col in categorical_cols:
    unique_count = df[col].nunique()
    print(f"\n{col}:")
    print(f"  Unique values: {unique_count}")
    print(f"  Top 5 values:")
    value_counts = df[col].value_counts().head()
    for value, count in value_counts.items():
        percentage = (count / len(df)) * 100
        print(f"    {value}: {count} ({percentage:.1f}%)")
    
    # High cardinality check
    if unique_count > 20:
        print(f"  ‚ö†Ô∏è High cardinality - consider grouping rare categories")
```

### Correlation Analysis

```python
# Correlation matrix for numerical variables
if len(numerical_cols) > 1:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
    correlation_matrix = df[numerical_cols].corr()
    sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0,
                square=True, linewidths=0.5)
    plt.title('Correlation Matrix - Numerical Variables')
    plt.show()
    
    # Find high correlations
    high_corr_pairs = []
    for i in range(len(correlation_matrix.columns)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(correlation_matrix.columns)):
            corr_value = correlation_matrix.iloc[i, j]
            if abs(corr_value) > 0.8:  # High correlation threshold
                high_corr_pairs.append((
                    correlation_matrix.columns[i],
                    correlation_matrix.columns[j],
                    corr_value
                ))
    
    if high_corr_pairs:
        print("High Correlation Pairs (|r| > 0.8):")
        for var1, var2, corr in high_corr_pairs:
            print(f"  {var1} - {var2}: {corr:.3f}")
```

### Target Variable Analysis (for supervised learning)

```python
# Replace 'target_column' with your actual target variable name
target_column = 'your_target_column'

if target_column in df.columns:
    print(f"Target Variable Analysis: {target_column}")
    
    # For classification targets
    if df[target_column].dtype == 'object' or df[target_column].nunique() < 10:
        target_counts = df[target_column].value_counts()
        print("Class Distribution:")
        for class_val, count in target_counts.items():
            percentage = (count / len(df)) * 100
            print(f"  {class_val}: {count} ({percentage:.1f}%)")
        
        # Visualize class distribution
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
        target_counts.plot(kind='bar')
        plt.title(f'Distribution of {target_column}')
        plt.xticks(rotation=45)
        plt.show()
    
    # For regression targets
    else:
        print(f"Target Statistics:")
        print(df[target_column].describe())
        
        plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
        plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
        plt.hist(df[target_column].dropna(), bins=30, alpha=0.7)
        plt.title(f'{target_column} Distribution')
        
        plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
        plt.boxplot(df[target_column].dropna())
        plt.title(f'{target_column} Box Plot')
        plt.show()
